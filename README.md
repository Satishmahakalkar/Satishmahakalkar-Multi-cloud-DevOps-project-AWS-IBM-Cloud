 🛠️ How to Set Up and Run the Infrastructure

 1. AWS & IBM Cloud Setup
- Create one VM each on:
  - ✅ AWS EC2 (Ubuntu 20.04)
  - ✅ IBM Cloud VSI (Ubuntu 20.04)
- Ensure SSH access is enabled (port 22)
- Open app port (e.g., 3000 or 80) in firewall/security groups

 2. Provision Infrastructure (Terraform)
```bash
cd terraform/aws
terraform init && terraform apply

cd ../../ibm
terraform init && terraform apply
3. Configure VMs (Ansible)
bash
Copy
Edit
ansible-playbook -i ibm-hosts ansible/ibm_playbook.yml
(Use aws-hosts and aws_playbook.yml if you have AWS setup too)

⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline Architecture
Tool Used: GitHub Actions
Workflow: .github/workflows/deploy.yml

Trigger
Every push to the main branch

Steps:
Checkout source code

Install Docker using official script

Build Docker image from ./app

(Optional) Deploy using Ansible to AWS/IBM VM

                [IBM VM] ← Ansible + Docker run
📈 Logs & Monitoring Access
Choose one based on your setup:

Option 1: Prometheus + Grafana (Open Source Stack)
Install Prometheus + Grafana on your IBM VM

Use Docker Compose to launch them

Expose ports 3000 (Grafana), 9090 (Prometheus)

Access dashboard via:

Option 2: Native Cloud Logs (Optional)
AWS CloudWatch or IBM Log Analysis can be configured with agent setup

🧠 Assumptions and Design Decisions
IBM and AWS each run a single VM for isolation and flexibility

Dockerized app ensures consistency across cloud environments

Terraform and Ansible are modular and reusable

GitHub Actions handles CI/CD because it’s tightly integrated with Git

💰 Cost Implications
Resource	Cloud	Est. Monthly Cost
1 x t2.micro EC2	AWS	~$8–10/month
1 x VSI	IBM Cloud	~$10–15/month
GitHub Actions	GitHub	Free (up to limits)
Using minimal VM specs (Ubuntu 20.04)

Docker containers avoid the need for additional VMs

Spot Instances or Reserved Instances can reduce AWS cost further

🔐 Security Considerations
SSH keys are managed via GitHub Secrets

Ansible connects via secure private key (not exposed in repo)

Docker image only exposes port 3000

OS is updated during provisioning (apt update in playbook)

No hard-coded credentials in Terraform/Ansible

### ✅ Next Steps:
- Save this as `README.md` in your root project directory.
- Commit & push it to GitHub:
  ```bash
  git add README.md
  git commit -m "Add project documentation"
  git push origin main
